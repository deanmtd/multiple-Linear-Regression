# multiple-Linear-Regression
**Overview**
This data set tells us how much money was spent on R&D, Administration, Marketing and profit margin. The rows represent 50 start-up companies. The profit is the dependant variable (this determines which companies will be picked as by venture capitalists. So we need to build a model that will determine which company/ies to pick based on the independent vars.

Our goal is to understand which factors (R&D vs marketing) yield better returns in terms of profits, and how administrative spending and location affect outcomes. The model will assist venture capitalists in making investment decisions.
